# Task 1: Inference

- Keep training data during inference (different from regression/classification: keep weight)
- Define public API for SVM: store param; given param how to inference to get the prediction
- Later on, keep only the support vectors.

# TODO list:

- [x] Infer using weight and bias.
- [ ] Infer using support vectors.
